# Simple Social Network

This application is a sample for a social network.
Includes Login(Main) Activity **(login - "test", password - "test")** and  Feed Activity.
The last one uses bottom navigation bar for switching types of news(Feed, Dashboard, Notification), but does not employ fragments. This makes Feed Activity much more compact.
