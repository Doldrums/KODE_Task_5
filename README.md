# Simple Social Network

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/46f350d69d914189bca160241dbe48cd)](https://app.codacy.com/app/Doldrums/Simple_Social_Network?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Doldrums/Simple_Social_Network&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This application is a sample for a social network.
Includes Login(Main) Activity **(login - "test", password - "test")** and  Feed Activity.
The last one uses bottom navigation bar for switching types of news(Feed, Dashboard, Notification), but does not employ fragments. This makes Feed Activity much more compact.
